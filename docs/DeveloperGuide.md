## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `+ /name Tan Ah Gao /id chihuahua69 /hp 999 /tag finance`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("- id abc123")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is first passed to an `AccountManagerParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `LoginCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. If the parsing result returned by `AccountManagerParser` is null, the command is then passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AccountManagerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `LoginCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `LoginCommand`) which the `AccountManagerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the tag data i.e., all `Tag` objects (which are contained in a `TagList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, user preference data and tag list data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `TagListStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Edit feature

#### Current Implementation

The edit mechanism was previously based on the index of the contact in the shown list of contacts,
but is now fitted to serve our new key identifier of an employee, namely the ID.
In addition, the ID of an employee now cannot be edited by any means (intuitive logic of unique ID),
hence any ID changes would mean that the employee needs to be deleted and added again with their new ID and information.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandFlow.puml" alt="EditCommandFlow" />

#### Kept changes from previous implementation
- Optional to edit all fields, at least 1 field is enough
- Fields can be entered in any order

#### Pros of ID as key
- Ensure that random employee details are not edited by accident
- Every edit command is now more purposeful as if ID is not found, edit does not go through

#### Cons of ID as key
- Slightly slower to type in than index
- Slightly slower to execute if employee list shown is huge



### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

Currently data is being archived via storing it locally as a `.json` file.

In the future, we are looking to create functions to export the data into different file formats such as `.xlsx`, `.pdf` or `.txt` files.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level 

In our development of Hi:Re, we give the difficulty rating as **8.5 / 10**.

The reasons for our rating will be expounded on in the following sections. <br>

### Challenges Faced
<br>

#### 1.Brownfield Project

When we were first introduced to the **software architecture** of Addressbook Level-3(AB3), as well as its **source code**,
we needed time to **dissect, simplify and understand** how every single section of AB3 worked. This was
to ensure that we did not dive in immediately and develop tunnel vision for something we would like to implement that
would cause the software architecture or application to have problems down the road.

**From there, we:**

Engaged in the tutorial provided by the course coordinators to practise adding code to the existing AB3. For most of our team,
it was the first time that we were adding on to a completed project's work, which gave us confidence and helped us gain
familiarity with the source code and its various files. Through the tutorial, we were able to have a glimpse into how
a chain of files and classes worked in tandem to produce the functionality as seen when we ran the application.

#### 2. Target Audience and Implementation

**Understanding AB3 was not a 1 time process, but ongoing**. As we looked back on our initial ideas in our document, we realised 
that given our time frame for development, we were **unable to implement some features immediately** due to us still getting used
to working with pre-existing AB3 source code. Having looked at AB3 again now in detail, we had to **ideate for new features**
that our **target audience would need and want**, as well as **crossing out previous ideas that now are not feasible**.

#### 3. Version Control

For our team, this was the **first time collaborating with others using version control**. We had to familiarise ourselves with
the standard workflow process, as well as helping to **review and test each other's code** before approving Pull Requests.
During v1.3's development phase, we encountered **merge conflicts** as features inadvertently affected one another. **Bugs** also
sprouted out that could not be seen from resolving merge conflicts, and we had to push out more changes to solve these bugs.

#### Learning outcomes for our team

Through the challenges faced, we came out as **more professional, responsible, collaborative and adaptive teammates**. 
Communication was key in our project, and we are all confident to say that we have emerged stronger from the challenges,
and have become a **close-knit team that helps one another**.


### Effort Required
     
We held **weekly meetings** to discuss work updates and plans for the next week, as well as communicated frequently in our channel
about updates, help needed, suggestions and ideas.

In the process of allocating each feature to a team member to implement, each team member needed to do **documentation, development,
testing and reviewing other's work**. As aforementioned, it was **difficult to work off an existing code base** and **integrate new features**
for our target audience in a **seamless and effective manner**. In our discussions itself, we **planned meticulously** as to minimise
any form of functionality overlap between members so that development would be smooth. In the cases where we had 2 members
work on a larger feature, they **collaborated to implement the feature in parts**.

Version control mastering also **takes time and effort to get it right every time**. With each week, we helped each other with 
understanding and getting the workflow right so that our work can follow a smooth and efficient process.


### Achievements of Project

In developing Hi:Re, we are proud to have done the following given the constraints and development time frame:

  1) Built features that our target audience (HR department employees and managers) would appreciate, such as the Exporting data Command.

  2) Improved the UI and upgraded AB3's original features to cater to our target audience. (See Design Methodology Section in UG)

  3) Created an advanced tag system feature to optimise contact tag management.

  4) For security and target audience consideration, our Account features serve to allow our target audience to 
     manage multiple addressbooks should they collaborate with different companies! (Refer to Disclaimer for Account Features in UG under Commands section)

### Code Reuse

  1) In making an advanced tag feature system, we referenced AB3's storage portion to create our own taglist.

  2) With ID becoming our main identifier of contacts, we referenced how AB3 did it for names previously and also
     continued that development path when we changed the delete feature.

  3) For most of the commands that AB3 had and we kept, we upgraded them to fit our new functionality.
     In the process, `Command` and `Parser` files were used as reference for new features that we implemented.
