## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `+ /name Tan Ah Gao /id chihuahua69 /hp 999 /tag finance`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("- id abc123")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is first passed to an `AccountManagerParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `LoginCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. If the parsing result returned by `AccountManagerParser` is null, the command is then passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AccountManagerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `LoginCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `LoginCommand`) which the `AccountManagerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the tag data i.e., all `Tag` objects (which are contained in a `TagList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, user preference data and tag list data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `TagListStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Edit feature

#### Current Implementation

The edit mechanism was previously based on the index of the contact in the shown list of contacts,
but is now fitted to serve our new key identifier of an employee, namely the ID.
In addition, the ID of an employee now cannot be edited by any means (intuitive logic of unique ID),
hence any ID changes would mean that the employee needs to be deleted and added again with their new ID and information.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandFlow.puml" alt="EditCommandFlow" />

#### Kept changes from previous implementation
- Optional to edit all fields, at least 1 field is enough
- Fields can be entered in any order

#### Pros of ID as key
- Ensure that random employee details are not edited by accident
- Every edit command is now more purposeful as if ID is not found, edit does not go through

#### Cons of ID as key
- Slightly slower to type in than index
- Slightly slower to execute if employee list shown is huge



### \[Implemented\] Undo/redo feature

Our undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by a `CommandList` inside the `Model` and an internal pointer to track the current command, offering a command-centric approach, which can be highly efficient and flexible.<br><br>

**Core Components**
1. `CommandList`: This list stores all the commands that have been executed. Each command in this list should be capable of reversing its effect (undo) and reapplying its effect (redo).

2. `CommandList.currentCommandIndex`: This pointer indicates the current position in the commandList. It helps determine which commands have been executed and which ones have been undone.

**Functionalities**
1. Executing a command:
   * When a new command is executed, it is added to the end of the commandList.
   * The current command pointer is moved to this new command's position.
   * Commands following the current command pointer (if any) are cleared from the list, as the new command creates a new "branch" of history, invalidating the redo history.<br><br>

2. Undoing a command:
   * To undo, check if the pointer is not at the beginning of the list.
   * The command at the current pointer position knows how to undo itself. It executes its undo method.
   * The pointer is then decremented, moving backwards in the command list.<br><br>

3. Redoing a command:
   * To redo, check if the pointer is not at the end of the list.
   * Increment the pointer to move to the next command in the list.
   * The command at this new pointer position knows how to redo itself and executes its redo method.<br><br>

4. Self-contained commands:
   * Each command object contains all the information necessary to both apply and reverse its effects. When a command is executed, it also prepares for its potential undo by storing any relevant state changes or backups of the data it modifies. Currently our undo/redo only supports the following commands.
   * Add: Stores a reference to the added person. To undo, it removes this person from the address book. To redo, it simply re-adds the stored person to the address book.
   * Delete: Stores a reference to the deleted person. To undo, it re-adds this person to the address book using the stored details. To redo, is removes the person again from the address book.
   * Edit: Stores a reference to the person before edit and another reference to the person after edit. To undo, it removes the person after edit and re-adds the person before edit. To redo, it removes the person before edit and re-adds the person after edit.
   * Clear: Stores a reference to the address book before clearing. To undo, it restores the address book to the state before clearing. To redo, it clears the address book again.


#### Design considerations:

Compared with the recommended way that stores the entire address book for each undo/redo, our command-centric approach has the following pros and cons:

**Pros:**

* Reduced Memory Usage: Since only changes are stored rather than the entire application state, this method typically consumes less memory. For instance, the delete command only needs to store the details of the deleted person, not the state of the entire address book.

* Scalability: As operations increase in complexity or frequency, storing individual command effects rather than snapshots of the entire state scales better. This makes the system more efficient and responsive as the volume of data grows.

* Flexibility and Modularity: Commands encapsulate their functionality, making the system more modular. This separation allows for easier updates and modifications to individual commands without affecting the overall system.

* Targeted Undo/Redo: This approach allows for precise control over what gets undone or redone, making the operations more predictable and less prone to errors that can occur when rolling back a full state.

**Cons:**

* Implementation Complexity: Each command must be correctly implemented with its own undo and redo logic. This increases the complexity of each command's implementation and requires careful design to ensure that each command properly and completely reverses its effects.

* Testing Overhead: The need for thorough testing increases as each command has its own undo/redo logic. There's a higher risk of bugs in individual commands, especially in scenarios where commands might interact or affect the results of each other.

* Dependency and State Consistency: Commands must be designed not to rely excessively on the specific state of the application that may be altered by other commands. Ensuring consistency and managing dependencies between commands can be challenging.

* Recovery from Errors: If an error occurs during the execution of an undo or redo operation, recovering and ensuring data integrity can be more complex, as the system must handle partial undos or redos gracefully.
### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

Currently data is being archived via storing it locally as a `.json` file.

In the future, we are looking to create functions to export the data into different file formats such as `.xlsx`, `.pdf` or `.txt` files.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level 

In our development of Hi:Re, we give the difficulty rating as **8.5 / 10**.

The reasons for our rating will be expounded on in the following sections. <br>

### Challenges Faced
<br>

#### 1.Brownfield Project

When we were first introduced to the **software architecture** of Addressbook Level-3(AB3), as well as its **source code**,
we needed time to **dissect, simplify and understand** how every single section of AB3 worked. This was
to ensure that we did not dive in immediately and develop tunnel vision for something we would like to implement that
would cause the software architecture or application to have problems down the road.

**From there, we:**

Engaged in the tutorial provided by the course coordinators to practise adding code to the existing AB3. For most of our team,
it was the first time that we were adding on to a completed project's work, which gave us confidence and helped us gain
familiarity with the source code and its various files. Through the tutorial, we were able to have a glimpse into how
a chain of files and classes worked in tandem to produce the functionality as seen when we ran the application.

#### 2. Target Audience and Implementation

**Understanding AB3 was not a 1 time process, but ongoing**. As we looked back on our initial ideas in our document, we realised 
that given our time frame for development, we were **unable to implement some features immediately** due to us still getting used
to working with pre-existing AB3 source code. Having looked at AB3 again now in detail, we had to **ideate for new features**
that our **target audience would need and want**, as well as **crossing out previous ideas that now are not feasible**.

#### 3. Version Control

For our team, this was the **first time collaborating with others using version control**. We had to familiarise ourselves with
the standard workflow process, as well as helping to **review and test each other's code** before approving Pull Requests.
During v1.3's development phase, we encountered **merge conflicts** as features inadvertently affected one another. **Bugs** also
sprouted out that could not be seen from resolving merge conflicts, and we had to push out more changes to solve these bugs.

#### Learning outcomes for our team

Through the challenges faced, we came out as **more professional, responsible, collaborative and adaptive teammates**. 
Communication was key in our project, and we are all confident to say that we have emerged stronger from the challenges,
and have become a **close-knit team that helps one another**.


### Effort Required
     
We held **weekly meetings** to discuss work updates and plans for the next week, as well as communicated frequently in our channel
about updates, help needed, suggestions and ideas.

In the process of allocating each feature to a team member to implement, each team member needed to do **documentation, development,
testing and reviewing other's work**. As aforementioned, it was **difficult to work off an existing code base** and **integrate new features**
for our target audience in a **seamless and effective manner**. In our discussions itself, we **planned meticulously** as to minimise
any form of functionality overlap between members so that development would be smooth. In the cases where we had 2 members
work on a larger feature, they **collaborated to implement the feature in parts**.

Version control mastering also **takes time and effort to get it right every time**. With each week, we helped each other with 
understanding and getting the workflow right so that our work can follow a smooth and efficient process.


### Achievements of Project

In developing Hi:Re, we are proud to have done the following given the constraints and development time frame:

  1) Built features that our target audience (HR department employees and managers) would appreciate, such as the Exporting data Command.

  2) Improved the UI and upgraded AB3's original features to cater to our target audience. (See Design Methodology Section in UG)

  3) Created an advanced tag system feature to optimise contact tag management.

  4) For security and target audience consideration, our Account features serve to allow our target audience to 
     manage multiple addressbooks should they collaborate with different companies! (Refer to Disclaimer for Account Features in UG under Commands section)

### Code Reuse

  1) In making an advanced tag feature system, we referenced AB3's storage portion to create our own taglist.

  2) With ID becoming our main identifier of contacts, we referenced how AB3 did it for names previously and also
     continued that development path when we changed the delete feature.

  3) For most of the commands that AB3 had and we kept, we upgraded them to fit our new functionality.
     In the process, `Command` and `Parser` files were used as reference for new features that we implemented.
